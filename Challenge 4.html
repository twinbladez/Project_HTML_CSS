			<h2>Human</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>A Resilient and Diverse People</summary>
							<p>The ruins of humanity's cities and shrines lay scattered across Tyria, serving as haunting reminders of their past glory. The Krytan city of Divinity's Reach, however, is very much alive, and stands as testament to human resilience, diversity, and spirit. With their six gods long silent, humankind can choose to fade into obscurity—or create a new future, standing equal with the rest of the world.</p>
				</details>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b><em> I call them noble humans. Nothing new about it.</em></p>

			<h2>Asura</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>Diminutive Mystical Scientists</summary>
						<p>They may be short in stature, but these magical inventors are intellectual giants. Incredibly intelligent beings, the asura use their knowledge and skill with magic and crafting to assert their natural dominance. In the world of the asura, it is not the strong who survive, but the clever. Other races believe they should rule by virtue of their power and strength, but they delude themselves.</p>
				</details>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b><em> I consider them the dwarves.</em></p>

			<h2>Sylvari</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>Mysterious Curious Plant Beings</summary>
						<p>Most sylvari are connected by the Dream, where their experiences in the world gather like dew under the branches of their mother, the Pale Tree. Some awaken for the first time with a path clear before them, but all must learn to balance freedom with duty, ardor with chivalry, and justice with honour.</p>
				</details>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b><em> Human plants.</em></p>

		<article>
			<h2>Norn</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>Towering Northern Hunters</summary>
						<p>In any legend worth telling, a single norn would have scaled the Shiverpeaks to hunt the Elder Dragon Jormag and returned with its head. In truth, Jormag drove the norn from their homeland; it lurks undefeated in the mountains, transforming hunters into its icebrood thralls. Any hero who faces it risks having their immortal legend untold, joining the vanquished hundreds in its shadow.</p>
				</details>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b><em> The giants.</em></p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h2>Charr</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>A Regimented Military Society</summary>
						<p>Once led by the fanatical Flame Legion, the charr have cast aside religion. Their strict military culture ensures that each charr has a place in the world…as long as they're able to carry out their duties. They value progress and innovation, despite their bloody history—but while "victory at any cost" is a principle most charr can agree on, having to rely on allies—including their ancient enemies—is a high price to bear.</p>

				<p><b>Note:</b><em> The wolves.</em></p>
